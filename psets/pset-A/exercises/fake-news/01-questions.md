# Proposals

- Proposal 1
    - Facebook relies on an algorithm, as well as individual user reports, to identify potentially "fake news" content. Once the content is identified, it is sent to third-party fact-checkers for verification. If the content is deemed fake news, it will be publicly flagged with a warning that the content is contested by fact-checkers.

- Proposal 2
    - However, a Facebook designer believes that there should be a different approach to content regulation.

Their proposal is that content deemed problematic by third-party fact-checkers should be entirely prevented from being shared on the platform.
