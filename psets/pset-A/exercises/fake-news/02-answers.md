1. **Which form of content regulation, Proposal 1 or Proposal 2, do you think is better? Why?**
    - This is a matter of balancing content moderation and preserving freedom of expression. Proposal 1 appears to be more balanced, as it allows contested content to be flagged, providing users with information about the accuracy of the information but still allowing them to decide whether to share it. Proposal 2, on the other hand, may be seen as more restrictive, as it completely prohibits the sharing of deemed problematic content. The choice between the proposals will depend on individual priorities and values regarding freedom of expression and misinformation moderation.
